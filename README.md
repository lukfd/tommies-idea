# Initial Proposal

I would like to present on the Redis Database. I decided to research Redis, because it is a technology I have never used, and I would like to know more about it. I am planning on setting up a Redis testcontainers and initialize a simple Redis database with some data. For a more advanced research I would like to aim at adding Redis Plugins to the testcontainers such as RedisJSON.
